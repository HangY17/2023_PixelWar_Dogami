# 2023_PixelWar_Dogami
Repo for DOGAMI template for the Reddit Pixel War (/r/place)

# What is the Pixel War ?
The Pixel War started in 2017 on Reddit on the r/place channel. It is a blank space of a 1000x1000 pixels dimension. The objective is to draw/write something you like. To do that, users can color (or leave blank) pixels one by one, each 5 minutes. People can overwrite your newly colorized pixel, so be careful and work as a team to overcome any challenge faced by other members trying to destroy your art.
### To participate, you must have a Reddit account

# What's the project ?
We want to create the DOGAMI logo on this 2023 edition. We need your help to do so. Thus, you have to perform few steps to help us get this DOGAMI logo on the fresco.
To better organize ourselves, we will use a browser add-on as well as a script to show where and how to color the pixels. This acts as a "canvas" to help us put the right color at the right spot. The DOGAMI logo drafted is a 68x15 pixels:

# How to get this script ?
## Step 1: Download a browser extension
* For Mozilla Firefox: [ViolentMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) *(TIP: click on the scroll wheel to open a new tab)*
* For Chrome/Opera: [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) *(TIP: click on the scroll wheel to open a new tab)*

## Step 2: Install the script in the browser extension
1. Click on the following script to install it on your newly installed plugin/add-on: [templateManager.user.js](https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager/raw/main/dist/templateManager.user.js). It should auto install the script and ask for a confirmation. Confirm the installation.

2. Import the PNG canvas  
Go on Reddit [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/).  

You should see on the top left corner a setting button:

4. Color the pixels accordingly !
The interior color of the pixel represents the color to be set, while the exterior color of the pixel is the current color of the pixel. Select the corresponding color (interior of the pixel), select the pixel and validate. Here you go, you are helping us setting the DOGAMI logo on the 2023 r/place !
